# PriceLint: Decentralized Price Prediction on Internet Computer

**PriceLint** is a decentralized platform for AI-driven price prediction, built on the Internet Computer (IC) and inspired by Predictoor.ai.

It implementing on-chain LSTM prediction using the Canister and Burn frameworks eliminates the need for local computation and achieves an accuracy rate slightly above 50%.

Users can deploy canisters, customize models, stake tokens, and trade AI configurations in a decentralized marketplace, creating a self-sustaining data ecosystem.

## Why PriceLint?

PriceLint democratizes price prediction, traditionally controlled by institutions, by leveraging ICP’s scalable infrastructure. It targets:

- **Crypto Traders**: Access real-time predictive data streams for trading strategies.
- **DeFi Participants**: Stake tokens to earn rewards and optimize predictions.
- **Data Scientists**: Share AI models, earning revenue through a follow-on profit-sharing model.

## Key Features

- **On-Chain AI**: LSTM models run in Canisters using the [ic-burn](https://github.com/LintDAO/ic-burn) framework for chain-native inference.
- **One-Click Deployment**: Deploy multiple Canisters with pre-configured or custom models.
- **Token Staking**: Stake tokens to submit predictions and earn rewards.
- **Model Marketplace**: Trade user-created AI configurations with 2-5% platform fees.
- **Real-Time Data Streams**: Data Farmer streams provide predictive data for traders.
- **Community-Driven**: Crowdsourced intelligence improves model accuracy over time.

## User Story

**Data Farmer X** logs into PriceLint via Internet Identity, deploys Canisters with one click, and tests LSTM model parameters for ICP price prediction.

After achieving >50% accuracy, X stakes tokens to submit predictions, earning rewards.

X shares optimized configurations in the marketplace, earning 2-5% follow-on profits.

**Trader Y** subscribes to X’s data stream, using predictions for high-frequency trading strategies.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend

- **Tech Stack**: Vue3, TypeScript, Pinia.
- **Features**: User-friendly interface for model selection, parameter tuning, token staking, and marketplace trading. Displays prediction leaderboards and annualized reward status.
- **ICP Utilization**: Internet Identity for secure, decentralized login; HTTPS Outcalls fetch real-time ICP/BTC prices from APIs (e.g., Binance, CoinGecko).

### Backend

- **Canisters (Rust)**:
  - **User Canister**: Stores model configurations, staking records, and prediction results.
  - **Prediction Canister**: Runs LSTM inference using [ic-burn](https://github.com/LintDAO/ic-burn), generating price predictions.
  - **Market Canister**: Manages model trading, transaction records, and 2-5% fee distribution.
- **ICP Utilization**:
  - **Chain-Native AI**: WebAssembly (WASM) enables on-chain LSTM inference, outperforming Predictoor.ai’s local bots.
  - **Low-Cost Transactions**: Fixed fees (~10B cycles per model training) support high-frequency predictions.
  - **High Throughput**: Sub-second confirmation ensures real-time data updates.
  - **ICRC-1 Tokens**: Support staking, rewards, and marketplace payments.

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
